In this project, I developed a comprehensive, Excel-based methodology to model and analyze the Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) for oil wells across different flow regimes. Specifically, I calculated and graphed the IPR for both linear (undersaturated) reservoirs (which follow Darcy's law) and non-linear (saturated/two-phase) reservoirs using industry-standard empirical correlations. For the linear regime, I demonstrated the impact of key variables, such as the skin factor, production time, and reservoir depletion, on the IPR curve. For the non-linear IPR, I carried out a comparative analysis between the Vogel and Fetkovich IPR equations, highlighting their differences in predicting the well's maximum potential (Absolute Open Flow or AOF) and determining which model is more reliable for real-world application using field test points.

I wrote an article to document the analysis. You can read the article [here](https://reservoir-diaries.hashnode.dev/inflow-performance-relationship-ipr-in-excel-linear-and-non-linear-ipr).
